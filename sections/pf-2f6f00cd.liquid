We'd love for you to start by introducing yourself.</h3></div></div></div><div class="sc-dhKdPU hjOBND pf-23_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-sm:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-iapVNj iUcVvL pf-24_"><p class="sc-gFVuLS jpmtwg pf-25_ pf-text-1" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">I immigrated to the United States at the age of eighteen, bringing with me a wealth of experiences from my life in China. Growing up in the 90s, I witnessed the rapid development of e-commerce, which fascinated me from a young age. The convenience it brought to consumers, offering more choices at lower prices, and the way it empowered small businesses to start with minimal costs, deeply influenced my career aspirations.<br><br>After graduating, I joined Alibaba, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world, to pursue a career in marketing. During my time there, I noticed a significant disparity between the shopping experiences in China and the United States. In China, products that were incredibly affordable could sell at much higher prices in the U.S., and Chinese consumers enjoyed a broader range of options. This realization inspired me to leverage my bilingual skills and multicultural background to bridge this gap and start a business that could benefit from the differences between these two markets.<br><br>My journey began with a personal passion—interior design. I observed that many young professionals, like myself, were interested in staging their homes beautifully but often struggled to find aesthetically pleasing furniture within their budget, especially when it came to rugs. Rugs, I realized, are not just decorative pieces but functional elements that can transform a space. However, the options available in the market were often traditional in style and prohibitively expensive. <br><br>Seeing this problem, I knew I had to act. I reached out to my best friend Vanessa, who lived in New York. She shared with me her challenges of moving five times in three years, each time having to leave behind rugs that were either too bulky or didn't fit in her new space. We both saw an opportunity to create a brand that offered stylish, affordable rugs that catered to modern tastes and lifestyles.<br><br></p></div></div></div><div class="sc-dhKdPU hjOBND pf-27_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-sm:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-iapVNj iUcVvL pf-28_ animate-grow"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0619/2998/0042/files/about_1_bbbb5523-a578-4f25-915a-72fc36ca16a7.jpg?v=1727333532" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0619/2998/0042/files/about_1_bbbb5523-a578-4f25-915a-72fc36ca16a7.jpg?v=1727333532 1536w" width="1200" height="1600" alt="Meet the Founders of LanySpace: Edie and Vanessa" title="Meet the Founders of LanySpace: Edie and Vanessa" data-action="url" data-href="/pages/about-us" data-target="_blank" data-pf-type="Image3" class="sc-bVHBsO cFdcpI pf-29_ pf-image-1 animate-grow"/><h4 data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-kAkozD kgiAhT pf-30_">Photo: Edie and her co-founder Vanessa during the early days of Lany Space.</h4></div></div></div><div class="sc-dhKdPU hjOBND pf-32_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-sm:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-iapVNj iUcVvL pf-33_"><p class="sc-gFVuLS jpmtwg pf-34_ pf-text-1" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">Starting a brand from scratch was a daunting task, especially since neither of us had prior experience in this field.

I believe every startup faces its own unique set of challenges, and ours was no exception—especially since Vanessa and I had little experience in the beginning. There was nothing smooth about the early days, from designing a simple website banner to setting up an email extension. We didn't receive any venture capital funding, which meant every penny spent came directly from our own pockets. My background is in marketing, and Vanessa's in human resources, but we found ourselves wearing many hats—playing the roles of designer, accountant, manufacturer, and logistics manager all at once.<br><br>Some of our struggles have been quite tangible. Last year, we faced a major setback when the transportation company we were working with, a company that had been in business for over a decade, suddenly collapsed without warning. Our products were detained by their warehouses as collateral for unpaid wages owed by the transport company. To retrieve our inventory, we had to cover these unpaid wages, which resulted in additional costs and significant delays. We called this ordeal a "natural and man-made disaster." While the financial loss wasn't astronomical, it was still a blow to our operations and morale.<br><br>Beyond these tangible setbacks, the more challenging struggles have been psychological. Three months after we launched the business, Vanessa became pregnant with her first child. It was a test for both of us—not just in balancing personal life and work but also in supporting each other through such significant life changes. This year, I also became pregnant and am expecting a baby girl this winter. Running a business is never easy, especially a women-founded business where both founders are experiencing pregnancy within the first two years. Despite these challenges, I'm grateful that we've always had each other's backs, providing unwavering support and understanding through every unexpected twist and turn.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="sc-dhKdPU hjOBND pf-44_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-sm:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-iapVNj iUcVvL pf-45_ animate-grow"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0619/2998/0042/files/LanySpace_Designer_Collection_Snake_Rug.jpg?v=1732264441" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0619/2998/0042/files/LanySpace_Designer_Collection_Snake_Rug.jpg?v=1732264441 1536w" width="971" height="746" alt="Vanessa, one of the co-founders of Lany Space, with her baby" title="Vanessa, one of the co-founders of Lany Space, with her baby" data-action="url" data-href="/products/spiral-snake-design-rug" data-target="_blank" data-pf-type="Image3" class="sc-bVHBsO cFdcpI pf-46_ pf-image-1 animate-grow"/><h4 data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-kAkozD kgiAhT pf-47_">Photo:  Vanessa, one of the co-founders of Lany Space, with her baby</h4></div></div></div><div class="sc-dhKdPU hjOBND pf-49_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-sm:12;--c-md:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-iapVNj iUcVvL pf-50_"><p class="sc-gFVuLS jpmtwg pf-51_ pf-text-1" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">We have grown alongside our business, transforming from two young women with a dream into young mothers and entrepreneurs.

In fact, our brand name, “Lany,” is a blend of these two iconic cities, paying homage to the dynamic energy and creativity they embody. Having lived in Los Angeles for over a decade, I've become deeply enamored with the city's sense of freedom and its vibrant, artistic environment. <br><br>What I love most about Los Angeles is the vast array of opportunities it offers to young professionals like us. Here, it feels like you can be anything you want to be—whether that's an actor, entrepreneur, tech innovator, or any other role. Los Angeles truly has everything you need; you just have to be willing to pursue it.<br><br>However, like many large cities, Los Angeles has its challenges. One of the biggest drawbacks is the rising cost of living, which has only been exacerbated by inflation, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic. It's concerning to see this become a potential barrier for people who love the city but are finding it increasingly difficult to afford. This challenge is also a driving force behind our mission at Lany Space—to offer young people more options to maintain a balanced and high-quality lifestyle without breaking the bank.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>
